I've created an online food shop where people can order dishes of different types to be delivered to their homes. I've implemented page transitions to ensure smooth and visually appealing transitions between pages. Buttons and links feature hover animations for enhanced user experience.

Responsive Design: The website is fully responsive and can be easily accessed and used on different devices. On smaller screens, a navbar icon appears, and upon clicking it, the navigation header is displayed.

Home.html: The homepage features a slider banner with various background images, showcasing the assortment of dishes available in the online food shop. Additionally, there are animated GIFs that illustrate how the ordering process works. The "Dishes of the Week" section highlights weekly specials with discounts. The footer includes navigation links, social media icons, and brief information about the shop.

About.html: This page provides information about the company, its history, and future plans. Similar to the homepage, there are visually appealing carts with box-shadow effects and hover animations. News and updates will be posted in these carts.

Menu.html: Here, visitors can browse and order different types of food. Each food category is presented with sliders and rows for easy navigation. Each item cart features hover animations for added interactivity.

Gallery.html: This page showcases photos of food items arranged in a grid layout. Each photo has hover animation and a pop-up window for downloading images, navigating between them, or closing the pop-up.

Contact.html: Visitors can find contact information, including links to Google Maps, phone calls, and email. Additionally, there's a form for users to ask questions or send live messages.

Shopping Cart: Clicking on the shopping cart icon reveals the cart window, where users can view and manage their selected products.

Log In: Clicking on the user icon opens the login window, where users can log in using their credentials.

Overall, the website aims to provide a seamless and enjoyable shopping experience for users looking to order food online.
